# Octave-Machine-Learning-Implementations
My implementation of machine learning algorithms in Octave. New code and projects built using knowledge gained from Andrew Ng's Coursera Machine Learning course in addition to his Stanford CS229 lecture videos.

# Timeline:
- Started:  Oct 30 2017
- Ended:  Currently in progress
  
# Algorithms (In order of completion)
1) Simple Linear Regression
2) Multiple Linear Regression (using normal equation)
3) Multiple Linear Regression (gradient descent and normal equation and comparing the performance)
3) Logistic Regression
4) Logistic Regression  (Regularization) with feature mapping
5) Neural Network
